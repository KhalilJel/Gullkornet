# Phase 11 — Production

Status: IN PROGRESS
Started: 2026-10-09

## Objective

Move Gullkornet from verified dry-run behavior to a tightly controlled production pilot with real sending, while keeping explicit human approval, suppression, idempotency, rate limits and an immediate kill switch.

## Locked safety boundaries

- No bulk production sending.
- First live send is limited to an explicitly approved recipient.
- No automatic 50–100/day ramp during the first acceptance.
- No DNS/MX changes.
- No secrets committed to GitHub.
- Production sender must be the verified Cidea domain.
- Every live send requires explicit runtime enablement, exact recipient approval, recipient review, suppression clearance and an idempotency key.
- Phase 12 remains locked.

## Step 1 — Production readiness audit

Verified from `main`:

- Phase 10 completed and merged.
- CI and KeeLead acceptance green on the Phase 10 merge.
- OpenOutSend Railway runtime healthy.
- `OPENOUTREACH_ALLOW_SEND=false` remains configured in the existing runtime.
- OpenOutSend bridge is still ingest-only.
- Resend reports `cideamarketing.com` as verified and sending-enabled.
- No DNS/MX changes were made.

Important architecture finding:

The current OpenOutSend HTTP bridge intentionally exposes only ingest and explicitly returns `send_triggered=false`. Therefore Phase 11 cannot safely claim production sending through that bridge until a separate production send boundary is implemented and tested.

## Step 2 — Production send configuration

Implemented on the Phase 11 branch:

- Default sender changed from the legacy SmartSvar address to `jelassi@cideamarketing.com`.
- The verified Cidea domain is confirmed active in Resend.
- Existing outbound gate remains explicit and fail-closed.

## Step 3 — Production send guard

The existing live-send guard requires:

- `GULLKORNET_ENABLE_LIVE_SEND=true`
- exact `GULLKORNET_APPROVED_RECIPIENT`
- `GULLKORNET_RECIPIENT_REVIEWED=true`
- verified `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Cidea sender
- suppression clearance
- `GULLKORNET_SEND_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`

Phase 11 tests add regression coverage for every gate.

## Current blocker before the first real prospect send

A real recipient has not yet been explicitly selected and approved for the first controlled production send. The system must not invent or silently select one for a live send.

The OpenOutSend bridge also remains ingest-only. This is intentional and must not be bypassed without implementing and testing a production send boundary.

## Next locked steps

1. Complete the Phase 11 production gate tests and CI.
2. Select one explicit pilot recipient for a controlled live send.
3. Verify the corresponding draft, recipient, suppression state and legal/marketing suitability.
4. Perform exactly one controlled live send.
5. Verify Resend acceptance and mailbox state.
6. Verify CRM state and duplicate protection.
7. Test reply detection and suppression behavior.
8. Only after successful acceptance, define the next small production batch.
9. Document results, commit and verify.
10. Mark Phase 11 COMPLETE only after all acceptance gates pass.

No Phase 12 work starts before this signoff.
